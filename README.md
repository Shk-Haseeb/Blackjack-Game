This Python-based project brings the classic card game Blackjack to the terminal with simplified rules for easy, engaging gameplay. Players compete against the computer, acting as the dealer, using cards drawn from an unlimited deck where all cards have equal probability. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points, and Aces count as 1 or 11, depending on the player's hand. Unlike traditional Blackjack, cards remain available after being dealt.

The game starts with each player receiving two cards. Players can "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (end their turn), while the dealer draws until reaching a score of at least 17. The goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding it. A score of 21 with the first two cards is an instant "Blackjack" win, while exceeding 21 results in a loss.

This project offers randomized card dealing, simple rules, and replay options for a fun terminal-based Blackjack experience.
